# Elixir playground

A really easy way to get started playing with Elixir.

```
git clone https://github.com/moredip/elixir-playground.git
cd elixir-playground
vagrant up
./iex
```

In addition to using `./iex` for the elixir repl you can also use `./elixir` to compile and run stuff in the playground directory.
